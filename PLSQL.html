    <h2>PL/SQL</h2>

      <p>PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language)</p>
<p>PL/SQL (Procedural Language/Structured Query Language) is a programming language extension for Oracle's SQL (Structured Query Language). It allows developers to write procedural logic, such as loops and conditional statements, directly within the SQL commands. Here's an overview of PL/SQL:
</p><p>
1. **Blocks**: PL/SQL programs are made up of blocks of code. A block consists of three parts: declaration, execution, and exception handling. Declarations define variables, cursors, and other program elements. Execution contains the actual code to be executed. Exception handling deals with errors that occur during execution.
</p><p>
2. **Variables**: PL/SQL supports variables of various types, including scalar types (such as integers and strings), composite types (such as records and arrays), and reference types.
</p><p>
3. **Control Structures**: PL/SQL provides control structures like loops (FOR, WHILE, LOOP), conditional statements (IF-THEN-ELSE, CASE), and branching (GOTO).
</p><p>
4. **Cursors**: Cursors are used to process rows returned by SQL queries one at a time. PL/SQL supports both implicit and explicit cursors.
</p><p>
5. **Exception Handling**: PL/SQL allows developers to handle exceptions (errors) that occur during program execution. Exception handling blocks can be used to gracefully handle errors and prevent abrupt termination of the program.
</p><p>
6. **Stored Procedures and Functions**: PL/SQL enables the creation of stored procedures and functions, which are named blocks of code that can be called and executed within SQL statements or other PL/SQL code.
</p><p>
7. **Packages**: Packages allow developers to encapsulate related procedures, functions, variables, and other program elements into a single named unit. This promotes modularity and code reusability.
</p><p>
8. **Triggers**: Triggers are special types of stored procedures that are automatically executed in response to specific events (such as INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) occurring on a table.
</p><p>
PL/SQL is widely used in Oracle database environments for writing stored procedures, triggers, and other database-centric applications. It provides a powerful toolset for implementing business logic within the database and optimizing performance by reducing network traffic between the application and the database server.</p>
